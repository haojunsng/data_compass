Data Compass is a repository dedicated to managing resources for my personal learning purposes. It may include configurations, such as `docker-compose.yml` files, to set up essential tools and services, providing a structured environment for personal projects.

## Features
- Pulls and integrates required resources via submodules (e.g. Configuration files from Zach's Bootcamp).
- Tracks and organizes learning progress, including projects and tasks. (Weekly Homework)
